#mach_star

`mach_star` is an open-source code suite for suppressing, replacing and/or extending Mac OS X functionality at a very low level. Its principal components are `mach_override` (replace and/or extend existing functions at runtime) and `mach_inject` (dynamically load your code into a running process). If you're new to mach_star, be sure to check out the [documentation](http://rentzsch.com/mach_star/#documentation) and [project layout](http://rentzsch.com/mach_star/#projectlayout) to get the lay of the land.
